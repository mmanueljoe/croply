### Empowering Farmers with Market Access & Agricultural Insights  

## Added a signup page

## 📌 Overview  
Croply is a frontend-only React application designed to help farmers in Ho access fair markets and critical agricultural information. It aims to improve market efficiency, reduce post-harvest losses, and enhance farmers' decision-making with real-time insights.  

## 🚜 Problem Statement  
Farmers in Ho face challenges such as:

- **Information Asymmetry**: Farmers struggle to negotiate fair prices.  

### 🚨 Consequences:  
- **Food Insecurity**: Farmers and their families struggle with low productivity.  
- **Rural Poverty**: Low income perpetuates economic challenges.  
- **Underdeveloped Agricultural Sector**: Market inefficiencies hinder sector growth.

✅ **Empower Farmers** – Offer tools and resources for better decision-making.
